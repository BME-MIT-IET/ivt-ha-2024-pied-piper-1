## Project Overview

Although this project didn't contain a README.md file, we explored the code and executed the application to gain insights into its structure and features. The project, My Practice, is an Android application designed with the goalto help doctors organize patient information and manage their appointments.

## Technology Used
The project is coded in kotlin with xml for the UI. We will be examining the kotlin code used for the above features. Since there are no pre-existing tests, we will create some unit tests and UI tests to help us check this project further.
