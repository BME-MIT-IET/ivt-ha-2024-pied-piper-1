We used both UI and unit tests to ensure the app is reliable and bug free. UI tests were important to simulate user interactions and verify the app works as expected while unit tests focused on checking the logic of individual components.  These tests cover everything from how users navigate through the interface to the internal workings of the functions.

The UI test methods focus on user interactions and navigation, making sure the app responds the way it s supposed to. <u>testRegisterInputAccepted</u> test method  fills out the registration form with all the right details clicks the Next button and confirms the app goes to the next screen. <u>testRegisterInputRejected</u>test method  is similar but enters an incorrect email to see if the app catches the mistake . <u>testBackNavigation</u> test method ensures that the back button returns users to the login screen with all the expected elements visible.  <u>testLoginSuccess</u> test method  simulates logging in with valid credentials and checks if the login screen disappears and that means that everything is going smoothly  .

The unit test methods handle the app s logic. <u>testCalculateAge</u> test method  tests an age calculator by giving it different birthdates to see if it returns the correct age. <u>testCertIDAssignment</u> test method  assigns a certification ID to a field and makes sure the ID is saved properly and <u>testNameValidation</u> test method  does the same for names but checks for errors if an empty name is given. <u>testPracIDValidation</u> test method  ensures  IDs are saved correctly and also catches mistakes if the field is empty or invalid.
